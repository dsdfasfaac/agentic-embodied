</div>

Zetta is an efficient closed-loop embodied harness for self-evolving physical intelligence. It evolves code-based runtime critics and recovery skills online while keeping the base policy frozen, achieving state-of-the-art success on LIBERO-Pro (90.8%) and RoboCasa (93.6%) with an 11.1x inference speedup.

## TODO

- [√] **August 18, 2026:** Open-source Zetta with LIBERO and Robocasa.
- [√] **August 19, 2026:** Open-source Z-Infra with LIBERO support.
- [√] **August 20, 2026:** Add RoboCasa support.
- [ ] **August 27, 2026:** Add NVIDIA Cosmos model support.
- [ ] **September 3, 2026:** Add RoboTwin environment support.
- [ ] **September 10, 2026:** Add ManiSkill environment support.
- [ ] **September 17, 2026:** Add BEHAVIOR environment support.
- [ ] **Ongoing:** Expand model and environment coverage at an approximate cadence of one integration per week.

## Evolution Protocol

```text
50 development rollouts (never use seeds 1..20)
  -> Failure Cluster
  -> Stage 1 causal Diagnose
  -> Stage 2 Critic-Recovery Candidates
  -> Shadow Replay
  -> paired Same-seed Gate
  -> Held-out seeds 1..20
  -> Reject and return to Stage 2, or Promote and complete
```

Runtime role boundaries:

- **Cluster** groups complete failed trajectories using synchronized video, bounded telemetry, and failure segments.
- **Stage 1 / Diagnose** explains one observable causal failure mechanism and cannot write or execute recovery actions.
- **Stage 2 / Candidate writer** emits one frozen Critic-Recovery bundle whose parameters must satisfy the published tool schemas.
- **Critic** reads temporal evidence and may only propose a recovery.
- **Role1** accepts or rejects a Critic proposal and is the sole high-level decision authority during candidate execution.
- **Recovery actor** executes only an accepted, bounded recovery program; only the environment actor may write simulator actions.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `zetta/evolution/` | Immutable manifests, queues, clustering, stages, gates, promotion, and supervision |
| `rollout_runtime/` | The Rollout Runtime: Gateway, EnvWorker/RolloutWorker groups, and backends for LIBERO/RoboCasa/ManiSkill/MuJoCo |
| `robots/libero/`, `robots/robocasa/` | Env clients, Role1/Critic/Recovery, tools, and rendering contracts |
| `scripts/evolution/` | Campaign preparation, workers, capacity probes, and plots |
| `scripts/deployment/` | Service start/stop, VLA env install, and Docker build helpers |
| `tests/` | Unit/contract tests; the minimal set requires no simulator or model |

A campaign root normally contains:

```text
manifest.json             frozen task, schedule, runtime, and gate contract
preregistration.json      seed and evaluation commitments
task-contract.json        authoritative language goal, when supplied
tool-catalog.json         exact tool schemas available to candidates
state.json                current lifecycle phase
episodes/                 canonical rollout and paired-gate records
failure-clusters/         Cluster inputs, visual indices, and outputs
diagnoses/                Stage 1 inputs, outputs, and audit trail
proposals/                Stage 2 candidate attempts
shadow-replay/            offline trigger and false-positive evidence
gates/                    same-seed, regression, and held-out decisions
promoted/                 verified candidate bundle and hashes
```

Videos, model weights, simulator assets, API credentials, and host runtime files remain outside Git.

## Installation

Python 3.10 through 3.12 is supported. The minimal test environment (no simulator/model required):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[test]"
```

### VLA runtime environment (LIBERO-Pro or RoboCasa)

`scripts/deployment/install_vla_env.sh` builds a venv for one of two tracks; the tracks cannot share a venv state (incompatible `robosuite` versions). See `scripts/deployment/VLA_ENV_SETUP.md` for the full bug log.

**LIBERO-Pro + Pi0.5**

```bash
REPO_ROOT=/abs/path/to/Zetta-Embodiment \
VENV_ROOT=/abs/path/to/venvs/vla-env \
  bash scripts/deployment/install_vla_env.sh --track libero-pro
```

`install_vla_env.sh` downloads the LIBERO-Pro scene/object assets automatically. To fetch or refresh them manually:

```bash
"$VENV_ROOT/bin/liberopro-download-assets" --skip-existing
```

**RoboCasa + GR00T** (needs a source checkout with `robocasa/`, `robosuite/`, `Isaac-GR00T/`)

```bash
REPO_ROOT=/abs/path/to/Zetta-Embodiment \
VENV_ROOT=/abs/path/to/venvs/vla-env \
ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT=/abs/path/to/robocasa-source-checkout \
  bash scripts/deployment/install_vla_env.sh --track robocasa
```

RoboCasa also needs its kitchen assets (~10GB); see the [RoboCasa installation guide](https://robocasa.ai/docs/build/html/introduction/installation.html) for details:

```bash
python -m robocasa.scripts.setup_macros              # set up system variables
python -m robocasa.scripts.download_kitchen_assets   # downloads ~10GB of kitchen assets
```

Prebuilt Docker images, built from `scripts/deployment/Dockerfile.vla-env`, are available for both tracks so you can skip the manual venv build:

- **LIBERO-Pro** image: preconfigured with the LIBERO-Pro simulator stack and Pi0.5 dependencies. [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1HW7AstjCLE_BTScRFOQT2g?pwd=qv7c)
- **RoboCasa** image: preconfigured with the RoboCasa/robosuite/Isaac-GR00T stack. [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Zyg2i_3tMp249PPLK6_JAw?pwd=ztcp)

### Generic MuJoCo runtime

Gymnasium MuJoCo is an independent optional track and must use its own venv:

```bash
python -m venv /path/to/mujoco-venv
/path/to/mujoco-venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[test,ray,mujoco]"
/path/to/mujoco-venv/bin/python -m pip check
```

The first-class `env_family: mujoco` backend supports state and headless EGL RGB
observations, continuous action chunks, LocalRuntime, and Ray EnvWorkers. See the
[MuJoCo integration guide](docs/integration/mujoco.md) for its configuration,
process-isolation model, success semantics, and staged validation commands.

## Runtime Rollout System

Campaigns drive rollouts through the Rollout Runtime rather than talking to a per-task VLA/env server directly. Start it once per host, then point campaign preparation at it:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 MUJOCO_GL=egl \
python -m rollout_runtime.cli serve \
  --config <preset-name-or-yaml-path> \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 18730 \
  --launch ray
```

`--launch ray` is required for real hardware runs: it puts the EnvWorker (simulator) and RolloutWorker (model inference) groups into separate processes. `--launch local` (the default) keeps them in one process and is only for local/CI smoke tests. Presets live under `rollout_runtime/config/presets/`; copy and edit one for machine-specific GPU/checkpoint paths rather than committing a new preset with real paths.

## Preparing and Running a Campaign

Both LIBERO and RoboCasa use the same two-step flow: `prepare_*_campaign.py` freezes a `manifest.json`/`tool-catalog.json` against a running runtime, then `run_campaign.py` drives the campaign state machine to completion.

```bash
# 1. Start the runtime (see above), then prepare the campaign against it.
python scripts/evolution/prepare_libero_campaign.py \
  --output-root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000 \
  --campaign-id libero-goal-s-task3-g0000 \
  --repository-root "$PWD" \
  --runtime-python .venv/bin/python \
  --code-commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --suite libero_goal_swap \
  --task-id 3 \
  --task libero_goal_swap/task3 \
  --task-language "Open the top layer of the drawer and put the bowl inside" \
  --master-seed 2026081103 \
  --rollout-count 50 \
  --fixed-heldout-seeds 1-20 \
  --heldout-mode test \
  --runtime-url http://127.0.0.1:18730 \
  --runtime-policy-id <policy-id>

# 2. Run it: this starts the worker, ingests episodes, and drives
#    Cluster -> Diagnose -> Stage2 -> Shadow Replay -> Same-seed -> Held-out.
python scripts/evolution/run_campaign.py \
  --manifest runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000/manifest.json \
  --root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000 \
  --queue-root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/queue \
  --tool-catalog runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000/tool-catalog.json \
  --workers libero-worker-0 \
  --model gpt-5.6-sol \
  --max-generations 1
```

`--worker-command` (optional, must be the final flag) overrides how each worker process is launched, substituting `{queue_root}`/`{host}` into a custom command template; omit it to use the default `zetta.evolution.cli worker` invocation.

`--runtime-url`/`--runtime-policy-id` replace the legacy `--vla-endpoint`/`--environment-gpus` flags; RoboCasa campaigns always go through the runtime (there is no direct-connect path). `ROLLOUT_COUNT=50`, `HELDOUT_COUNT=20`, and the official horizons are the formal-run defaults; a quick infrastructure check may use 1/1/1 with a positive `CAMPAIGN_MAX_STEPS`, but that is not a benchmark result. Each preparation script's `--help` output is the authoritative option list.

To inspect a campaign read-only:

```bash
python -m zetta.evolution.cli status --root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000 \
  --queue-root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/queue
```

## Tests

```bash
# Contract suite, no simulator/model required:
python -m pytest -q tests/test_evolution_protocol.py tests/test_evolution_core.py tests/test_libero_eval_horizon.py

# Everything currently available:
python -m pytest -q
```

Optional-backend tests require the corresponding dependencies; hardware/service smoke tests live under `scripts/deployment/` and are not part of the minimal unit suite.

## Security and Reproducibility

- Store secrets only in environment variables or permission-restricted external files. Artifacts record only route names and irreversible fingerprints, not keys or service URLs.
- Keep development seeds disjoint from held-out seeds 1..20.
- Preserve manifests, tool catalogs, prompts, bundles, and episode records by content hash; do not edit a running campaign in place.
- Classify infrastructure failures separately from valid task failures; they do not count as zero scores and cannot become learning signals.
- Use privileged simulator state only through an explicitly authorized and auditable diagnostic feature contract; it must not become hidden task control.
- Treat held-out results as test-only unless `heldout_mode=validation` is preregistered before any episode runs.
