"""Lane state and the lockstep coalescing executor shared by the three rlinf
families (M6).

M4 has only one real family (libero), so the "slot → family env" mapping was
directly hardcoded as "one slot, one ``num_envs=1`` env". M6 adds maniskill and
robocasa and requires ``SlotGroupCoalescer`` to do real coalescing, giving rise
to two forms (``core.env_execution.CORE_FORMS``):

- ``per_slot``: each slot has its own ``num_envs=1`` family env, with slots
  fully independent (M4 semantics);
- ``lockstep_vector``: the whole pool is a single ``num_envs=pool_size`` family
  env, with slots as its lanes, and ``chunk_step`` calls for the same pool and
  tick merged into a single call.

This module holds only the **family-agnostic** half: lane state, observation
assembly (rlinf's 5-key schema is shared across all families), and the lockstep
advancement algorithm. Family differences (reset signature, cfg projection,
action preprocessing, privileged extensions) stay in each family's own
``backends/rlinf_*.py``.

The four masking semantics for lockstep (the first three finalized earlier, the
fourth added 2026-08-07; this is where they are implemented):

1. Before the first ``chunk_step``, **every lane in the pool must have already
   been reset** — a family's ``step`` advances all lanes at once, and a
   never-reset lane cannot be touched even once (an un-``reconfigure``-d libero
   subprocess would break);
2. An absent lane is carried forward using the **hold action declared by the
   family**, and ``masked_steps`` is accumulated per lane; its simulation time
   **really has** advanced, so the executor refreshes its observation cache at
   wrap-up, never pretending nothing moved;
3. **Early stop within the group**: the vector advances until either "the
   chunk is exhausted" or "any lane **newly** terminates". A lane that has
   already terminated (``frozen``) no longer triggers early stop, otherwise one
   finished lane would compress the whole pool's batch length down to 1.
4. Semantics 2 only guarantees that the **core side** honestly records the
   facts, while this function only returns a ``ChunkOutcome`` to participants,
   so the state of an absent lane must be **read back** by the worker
   (``lane_statuses`` / ``LaneStatus``, worker-side ``_sync_lockstep_pool``).
   Without this step, ``RuntimeEnvWorker``'s ``SessionSlot`` would run
   inference on a stale frame, and a masked termination's success would be
   treated as "still running". The readback merely **discovers it earlier**: if
   it fails to happen, a ``frozen`` lane that later enters as a participant
   will still get an outcome from this function with ``executed_horizon=0`` and
   the termination flag set to **true**, rather than an ``Ok`` with
   ``terminated`` false.

    The core side honestly records this (``lane.masked_steps`` /
