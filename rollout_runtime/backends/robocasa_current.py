"""The robocasa family's ``EnvExecutionCore``.

**Does not reimplement RoboCasaSession**: ``robots.robocasa.session_core.RoboCasaSession``
is reused as-is — it is already a standalone class, its constructor arguments are
scalars, and ``reset``/``execute_chunk`` are already pure dict in/out. This module
does exactly three things: translate Runtime's session/slot semantics into
``RoboCasaSession`` calls, normalize its output through
``core.env_execution.normalize_chunk_outcome``, and encode the images in an
observation into the ``PayloadRef`` needed by ``Observation``.

Key divergences from libero / maniskill (confirmed against
``env_registry.py::ENV_FAMILY_BEHAVIORS["robocasa"]``; see that file's field
comments for details):

1. **``build()`` constructs ``num_envs`` independent ``RoboCasaSession``
   instances**, not one vectorized env taking a ``num_envs`` parameter —
   ``RoboCasaSession`` itself only wraps **one** ``gymnasium.make(...)`` call and
   has no batch dimension. Because of this, this family declares **only
   ``per_slot``** (``core_forms=frozenset({PER_SLOT_FORM})``); ``lockstep_vector``
   has no meaning here.
2. **``RoboCasaSession.reset``/``execute_chunk`` take a single dict payload**
   (``task``/``seed``/``split``/...), not any of the four "env index + keyword"
   signatures used by rlinf families (``reset_signature="task_seed_split_payload"``,
   already updated accordingly in env_registry.py).
3. **``execute_chunk``'s per-step records carry no images** (``session_core.py``'s
   step_record only records ``state``, skipping image encoding for HTTP bandwidth
   reasons) — so the per-step ``Observation`` objects constructed by this adapter
   likewise carry no images (``chunk_obs_layout="per_step"`` still holds: it does
   return an observation per step, just without images for the intermediate
   steps; only the final frame has one). The final frame's image is instead
   assembled by reading ``session.observation`` (the raw gym dict, always
   available, zero extra encoding cost) directly, rather than depending on the
   ``observation`` field in ``execute_chunk``'s return value; state is likewise
   reused from ``session.snapshot(include_images=False)`` / the per-step
   ``state_record``, since they already fold
   ``privileged_state.extract_privileged_state`` into ``state`` and there is no
   need to reimplement that folding.
4. **Needs an accelerator but is not a batched GPU tensor**: rendering forces
   ``MUJOCO_GL=egl`` (a module-level setting in ``session_core.py``), but
   ``RoboCasaSession`` is single-process numpy and does not do the kind of batched
   tensor computation maniskill does — ``needs_accelerator_override=True`` is
   declared independently.

Critic-Recovery and episode wrap-up:

- ``critic_rules`` does **not** go into ``env_config`` (it goes into
  ``EnvSpecMsg.digest()``, and changing the rule set every episode would create a
  new env pool each time), but instead goes through ``ResetSpec.options``: a
  bundle is frozen, the rules are constant within one episode, and
  ``RoboCasaSession._configure_critic`` itself refuses to change rules mid-episode.
  The adapter records it, alongside ``video_dir``/``bundle_sha256``/
  ``interrupt_on_proposal``/``capture_event_images``/``action_scale``, on the slot
  at ``reset`` time and replays it as-is on every ``execute_chunk`` call — an
  earlier version hardcoded ``critic_rules=[]`` here, which meant the Critic could
  never make a proposal and the ``active_bundle`` mode had no meaning on the
  Runtime path.
- ``extensions`` declares two methods (``core.env_registry.ROBOCASA_EXTENSIONS``;
  see that constant's comment for the rationale): ``robocasa.snapshot`` for
  Role1's visual review and Gen0's observation identity, and
  ``robocasa.finalize_episode`` to flush video to disk. Privileged state still
  does not need a separate extension method
  (``privileged_state.extract_privileged_state`` is already folded into every
  observation's ``state`` by ``RoboCasaSession._current_observation``).

Seed semantics differ from the other families: ``reset`` uses ``ResetSpec.seed``'s
**raw value**, with no ``seed_offset``/``slot_index`` offset applied (see
``reset``'s docstring).

Dependency surface: depends only on ``robots.robocasa.session_core`` (numpy +
gymnasium + robocasa + robosuite, all lazily imported by that module itself); does
not introduce rlinf or torch.

    Fields correspond one-to-one with ``RoboCasaSession.__init__``/``reset``'s
    payload, with defaults matching the CLI defaults in
    ``robots/robocasa/env_server.py::main``.

    Does not include ``operation_gate_*`` fields: ``RoboCasaSession`` used to
    support, via ``GpuOperationGate``, a deployment form where "multiple
    *independent OS processes* share one GPU" (an flock-based semaphore). That
    dependency (``gpu_gate.py`` and ``RoboCasaSession``'s reliance on it) has
    since been removed (along with the multi-process shared-GPU deployment path
    in ``env_server.py``/``robocasa_capacity_worker.py``, which is no longer
    supported). Ray's placement declaration
    (``cluster.component_placement`` + ``env_worker.placement_strategy=packed``)
    already guarantees **one Ray rank exclusively owns one GPU**, so the same
    GPU will never again be contended for by a second *process*; the
    concurrency of multiple sessions (threads) within one rank sharing the same
    card is instead controlled by ``env_worker.max_sessions_per_rank`` (set to 1
    in this preset, see ``config/presets/robocasa_current.yaml``). The field
    itself was already removed from ``RobocasaCurrentConfig`` earlier; this
    paragraph preserves the historical context.

            ``gymnasium.make(f"robocasa/{task}", ...)``.
        split: The task split (``"train"``/``"target"``, etc.).
        camera_size: Camera resolution (square edge length).
        max_steps: Maximum steps per episode.
        cold_reset_lock: Path to a cross-process renderer-creation mutex lock;
            ``None`` means no locking (single-process scenario).
        require_isolated_renderer: Whether to require an isolated MuJoCo
            renderer (true by default in production).
        enable_task_program: Whether to enable the task program (e.g. the
            dishwasher rack state machine).
        interrupt_on_proposal: Whether to interrupt a chunk when the
            critic/task program makes a proposal.
        capture_event_images: Whether proposal events include images (via a
            JPEG data URL, at a bandwidth cost; only enable when audit
            screenshots are actually needed).
        process_isolation: Whether to put each slot's ``RoboCasaSession`` in its
            own independent OS subprocess
            (``robots.robocasa.session_process.RemoteRoboCasaSession``), rather
            than constructing it directly within this rank's process. Defaults
            to false (preserving existing behavior/unit tests unchanged; the
            ``pool_size=1`` scenario has zero extra IPC overhead). Only needs
            to be enabled when ``pool_size > 1`` within the same rank (multiple
            sessions sharing one GPU): ``env_worker.py::_call_pool_core`` takes
            no lock at all for ``per_slot`` pools, assuming slots are
            independent — that assumption holds at the Python thread level, but
            two threads' ``reset()`` calls would simultaneously enter native
            robosuite/MuJoCo/EGL initialization paths
            (``_set_mujoco_context_and_buffers``/``from_xml_string``, etc.),
            which in practice randomly produces an ``EGL_BAD_ACCESS`` crash or a
            complete deadlock (two manifestations of the same race window, see
            the process-isolation design notes §0.2). A genuine OS process
            boundary prevents two slots from sharing the same native GL/EGL
            state; a Python lock cannot, because the race is in native code
            outside the Python lock's protection.

    The last three items are **family default values** that can be overridden
    per episode by ``ResetSpec.options`` (see ``_EpisodeOptions``): they do not
    affect the env pool's identity, and are placed in ``env_config`` only to
    give callers without per-episode needs a static default.

        quality=80 lossy quantization pass (the same quantization parameters
        as the JPEG data URL branch of
        ``RoboCasaSession._current_observation``/``snapshot``; see that
        function's docstring), then encoded with
        ``payload_module.encode_image`` (PNG): PNG is only a **transport**
        encoding that saves a base64/JSON round trip within the local process,
        and cannot change the pixels GR00T actually sees — policy inference is
        deterministic (per ``groot_core.parse_inference_seed``'s per-request
        seed contract), and skipping the quantization would feed the same seed
        "cleaner" pixels on Runtime v3 than before, silently changing the
        action-chunk values and making same-seed replays no longer match
        pre-migration episode records item-by-item. State is reused from
        ``snapshot(include_images=False)``: it already folds
        ``privileged_state.extract_privileged_state`` into the ``state`` field
        (see the module docstring), and there is no need to reimplement that
        folding logic.

        When ``self.config.process_isolation`` is true, ``slot.session`` is a
        ``session_process.RemoteRoboCasaSession``, with no ``session.observation``
        same-process attribute to read — detected via
        ``getattr(session, "observe_encoded", None)`` (the same posture as
        ``EnvPool.dynamic``'s detection of ``add_slot``/``remove_slot``). On
        that branch, the JPEG quantization above happens inside the
        subprocess (see ``session_process.py``'s ``_observe_encoded``), but
        the PNG **transport** encoding is still done in this method (the
        parent process): ``robots/robocasa/session_process.py`` belongs to
        ``robots/robocasa/**``, and per this repository's layering rules it
        cannot import ``rollout_runtime``, so ``payload_module.encode_image``
        cannot be moved into the subprocess. The ``Observation`` produced by
        both branches is entirely equivalent at the pixel/field level; only
        the PNG encoding happens after the subprocess finishes JPEG
        quantization, going through the same ``payload_module.encode_image``
        call once control returns to the parent process (not two independent
        implementations).

        ``Observation.state`` is a flat vector (this field's declared type),
        but GR00T (``groot_core.py::STATE_FIELDS``) reads state by **named**
        keys (e.g. ``state.end_effector_position_relative``), and flattening
        would lose the key names. So the named dict is preserved as-is here in
        ``extras["raw_state"]``, and ``groot_policy.py`` retrieves values by
        name from there, without depending on the flat vector's ordering
        convention.
