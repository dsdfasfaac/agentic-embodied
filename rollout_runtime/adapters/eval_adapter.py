"""Evaluation Adapter.

``run_episodes(tasks, seeds, policy)``: N tasks x M seeds -> batch-create
**temporary** sessions -> ``run_episode`` -> ``close`` on completion ->
results into a sink.

Three deliberate boundaries:

1. **Do not reimplement ``run_episode``**. ``RuntimeEnvWorker.run_episode``
   already has four termination conditions (``max_steps`` / ``deadline`` /
   cancel / terminated·truncated) and a ``TransitionSinkHub``; writing
   another loop would create two competing termination semantics. This
   adapter is only responsible for orchestrating session lifecycle and
   bookkeeping.
2. **``pool_size >= concurrency``**. This follows directly from design
   decision D6: the pool is reused keyed by ``EnvSpecMsg.digest()``, and
   ``pool_size`` is part of that digest, so the same spec only has
   ``pool_size`` slots — the ``pool_size + 1``-th ``create_session`` gets
   ``QUOTA_EXCEEDED``. This adapter therefore raises ``pool_size`` to match
   the concurrency itself. **But ``pool_size`` is per-rank**: every
   EnvWorker rank that receives a session builds its own pool according to
   it. When running across multiple env ranks, either pass ``concurrency``
   as "the slot count for a single rank," or set
   ``env_spec.pool_size`` to ``ceil(total_concurrency / env_ranks)``
   yourself — otherwise the number of environment instances will multiply
   by the rank count.
3. **Success is an explicit environment result, and valid / invalid
   episodes are booked separately.** ``EpisodeResult.success=None`` means a
   return-only task with no binary success metric; it remains a valid
   episode but is excluded from the binary success-rate denominator.
   Infrastructure faults (``Err`` / ``ENV_FAILURE`` / ``WORKER_LOST``) are
   invalid episodes, counted in neither metric and listed separately under
   ``invalid``.

This is the second piece of evidence (the first being the Gym Adapter) that
"the Runtime is decoupled from Agent semantics": the entire eval path only
uses ``RuntimeClient``'s public methods, knows nothing about LIBERO or the
planner, and cannot reach the transport or the workers.
