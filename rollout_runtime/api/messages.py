            ``"robotwin"`` / ``"fake"`` etc.).
        env_config: Family-private configuration passed straight through to
            the adapter.
        pool_size: The initial slot count of the env pool for this spec
            (fixed at construction time for the ``lockstep_vector`` form and
            never grows dynamically; for the ``per_slot`` form this is the
            initial value, which can be dynamically scaled within
            ``[pool_size, max_dynamic_pool_size]`` as needed, see

        max_dynamic_pool_size: The upper bound on the slot count the
            ``per_slot`` form is allowed to scale up to. Defaults to

            preserving the fixed-pool behavior; only setting it explicitly
            above ``pool_size`` enables on-demand scaling. Has no effect for
