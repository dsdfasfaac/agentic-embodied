"""EnvWorker capability, capacity, and heartbeat.

Invariant: on heartbeat timeout, the rank is immediately marked unhealthy,
and any sessions on it are transitioned by the Gateway to ``LOST``. v1 does
not implement ``LOST`` recovery (a newly created environment cannot resume
physical state).

Rank selection order: can serve this env spec -> can create a slot -> lowest
load -> smallest rank (deterministic).
