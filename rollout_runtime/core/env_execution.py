"""The environment execution-core interface.

``EnvExecutionCore`` is a thin adapter layer: **it does not rewrite rlinf
env**. 16+ env families have been confirmed to share the same constructor
signature ``(cfg, num_envs, seed_offset, total_num_processes, worker_info)``
plus ``reset/step/chunk_step/update_reset_state_ids/is_start``, so the real
implementation just translates the Runtime's session/slot semantics into
family calls, reusing ``action_utils.prepare_actions`` /
``envs/utils.to_tensor`` / ``venv/venv.py`` / ``EnvOutput`` verbatim.

This module holds three things, all stdlib + numpy:

1. ``ChunkOutcome``: the normalized structure;
2. ``EnvFamilyBehavior``: the **declarative** expression of the "six
   confirmed divergences" table -- family adapters self-describe against
   it, and upstream code no longer has to guess;
3. ``normalize_chunk_outcome``: the sole normalization exit point. libero /
   maniskill / realworld's ``obs_list`` length equals the chunk_size, while
   robotwin submits the whole chunk and only returns 1
   (``robotwin_env.py:322``) -- both come out of here, so upstream code
   never treats one family's chunk length as a universal contract.

The implementation that actually touches rlinf is in
``backends/rlinf_env.py``.

``RoboCasaSession.reset(payload)``: a single dict payload (``task`` /

    Why this is only offered for ``per_slot``: in this form, each slot is
    a fully independent family env instance (e.g. libero's
    ``LiberoEnv(num_envs=1)``), sharing no state with each other, so
    appending or closing one slot doesn't affect the rest. In the
    ``lockstep_vector`` form, all slots are lanes of **the same**
    vectorized env; appending/removing a lane is equivalent to
    reconstructing the entire scene with a different ``num_envs`` (GPU
    tensor buffers are allocated by batch size at construction time), so
    this form does not provide this protocol -- when ``EnvPool`` can't
    detect it, the pool stays fixed and scale-up requests still get
    ``QUOTA_EXCEEDED`` as before.

    success being mistaken for "still running". ``observe`` can recover
    the observation, but not the termination flag -- which is exactly why
