"""Batch evaluation semantics for ``adapters/eval_adapter.py``.

Assertion focus:

- It is a **thin wrapper** around ``run_episode``: termination conditions
  all come from the worker, and the adapter itself never counts steps;
- A temporary session is **closed as soon as it finishes**, so ``pool_size``
  slots can be reused by later batches (the pool never grows);
- ``pool_size`` is automatically raised to the concurrency level, otherwise
  the ``pool_size + 1``-th session gets ``QUOTA_EXCEEDED``;
- Binary success comes only from the environment's explicit success signal,
  with return-only and invalid episodes tallied separately;
- The transition genuinely reaches the sink.
