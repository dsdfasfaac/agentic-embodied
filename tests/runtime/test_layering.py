"""Layered import guard (five rules governing module boundaries).

Uses AST scanning of import nodes without executing the module — this way the
guard still applies even when a module is missing a local dependency (rlinf /
mujoco).

Five rules:

1. No file under ``rollout_runtime/**`` may have a top-level import of
   ``zetta`` / ``robots``;
2. ``api/**`` only allows stdlib (the sole exception: ``api/wire.py`` may
   import ``msgpack``, since the design requires msgpack serialization);
3. ``gateway/**`` must not import ``ray`` / ``rlinf`` / ``torch``;
4. ``core/**`` must not import ``ray`` / ``rlinf``;
5. Reverse direction: ``rollout_runtime`` being imported by ``zetta`` /
   ``robots`` is only allowed in ``robots/libero/__init__.py`` and
   ``robots/robocasa/__init__.py`` (the single injection point for each
   family).

Rule 5 exists to block "the legacy zetta / robots path silently depending on
runtime" (the default path must have zero changes). Every entry in this
allowlist is a tool belonging to runtime itself (in the same category as
``runtime_ci.sh``), and of course they import ``rollout_runtime``:

- ``runtime_transport_spike.py``: a quantitative baseline tool;
- ``runtime_parity_trace.py``: a single-arm data-collection tool for parity
  checks (each arm runs its own process; see the module docstring of
  ``test_legacy_parity.py``);
- ``smoke_mujoco_runtime.py``: staged native/Gymnasium/core/LocalRuntime/Ray
  acceptance tooling for the Runtime's MuJoCo backend. It is not imported by
  any application or legacy execution path.
- ``prepare_rebot_g1d_assets.py`` / ``smoke_rebot_g1d.py``: constrained asset
  preparation and real-scene acceptance tools for the MuJoCo backend. They are
  not imported by an application or legacy execution path.
- ``run_ab_runtime.py``: an A/B driver that needs to freeze the identity of
  the runtime preset (topology / policy backend / ``chunk_size`` / digest)
  into the report, otherwise the report would only say "rollout arm" without
  specifying which one. It is **not** on the legacy execution path: both arms
  are ``zetta`` subprocesses it forks, and the legacy subprocess's
  ``--runtime legacy`` path never executes a single line of runtime code.
- ``m6_acceptance/rr_eval_bench.py`` / ``rr_probe_libero_vec.py`` /
  ``rr_probe_robocasa.py``: scripts used to collect numbers on a GPU host
  (moved into the repository per an independent audit requirement, since
  otherwise those numbers would not be reproducible). All three only import
  ``rollout_runtime`` and are unrelated to the legacy path; the ``README.md``
  in the same directory explains how to run them.
- ``m7_acceptance/rr_serve_probe.py``: an acceptance probe for the served
  form (auth negative cases + ``application_id`` attribution + ``/metrics``
  scraping), using only ``api.wire`` to encode/decode HTTP bodies.
- ``m7_acceptance/rr_lost_probe.py``: a live driver for the scenario of
  killing an EnvWorker rank. It must be able to ``ray.kill`` an env actor, so
  it is a runtime tool unrelated to the legacy path.
- ``m7_acceptance/rr_eval_batching.py``: batched re-sampling evaluation, a
  same-format counterpart to ``rr_eval_bench.py`` plus batching parameters and
  a forward-pass counter.
- ``m7_acceptance/rr_serve_overhead.py``: a ``policy_step`` micro-benchmark
  across the embedded / ASGI / TCP arms, providing the per-round-trip cost
  (required in the repository per an independent audit requirement).
- ``run_concurrency_ab.py``: a **concurrent** A/B driver for legacy vs.
  rollout, where both arms share the same scripted workload definition (no
  planner). The rollout arm installs its own runtime (``launch/`` +
  ``config/``) and drives ``RuntimeClient`` directly, while the legacy arm
  only forks ``env_server`` / ``vla_server`` subprocesses and never executes a
  single line of runtime code — so it is in the same category as
  ``run_ab_runtime.py``: a runtime tool that is not on the legacy execution
  path.
- ``zetta_robocasa_seam_latency.py``: an independent latency probe for the
  robocasa seam (``RuntimeSeam`` + ``RuntimeEnvClient`` + ``RuntimePolicyClient``),
  connecting directly to ``rollout_runtime.adapters.zetta`` without going
  through ``zetta.cli.main`` or the ``robots/robocasa/__init__.py`` injection
  path, and therefore also not on the legacy execution path. It uses
  ``transport.kind=inproc`` to avoid the intermittent GCS heartbeat timeouts
  that occur with the ``ray_channel`` form on shared GPU machines (unrelated
  to the seam code itself).
- ``libero_critic_recovery_latency_v3.py``: a single-arm latency probe that
  semantically mirrors ``examples/libero_pi05_critic_recovery/run.py`` on the
  main side, driving ``build_local_components`` directly with
  ``asyncio.run()`` (``transport.kind=ray_channel``, real rlinf policy
  backend + libero family), and not going through any legacy/zetta execution
  path — each arm runs its own process, and the legacy subprocess likewise
  never executes a single line of runtime code (in the same category as
  ``run_ab_runtime.py``/``run_concurrency_ab.py``). It imports directly
  instead of going through the ``run_ab_runtime.py`` framework because this
  probe only measures the online latency of the rollout_runtime single arm
  under real LIBERO-Pro + Pi0.5 + Critic-Recovery, and does not need the
  fork/manifest mechanism shared by the A/B arms.

New entries must also explain why they belong to runtime tooling rather than
the legacy path.
